# Vue Plain Simple SFC like

Just a simple test/playground for building Single File Component-like structure, but for plain html/css/js project, without any bundler nor anything.

Still figuring things out here, WIP.

Test URL: [https://simple-vue-sfc.surge.sh](https://simple-vue-sfc.surge.sh)

Todo:
- learn and implement prefetch stuff - [https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf](https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf)
- improve the CSS in SFC way, it is kinda ugly (at least it accepts js variables)
- add Vuex
- ~~prevent from repeating &lt;style&gt; for each repeated component (see source  code, it repeats the style of codeapp component)~~
